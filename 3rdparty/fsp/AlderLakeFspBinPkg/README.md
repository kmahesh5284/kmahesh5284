# AlderLakeFspBinPkg
These FSP binaries are intended to be used with 12th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets (formerly known as Alder Lake).

## Alder Lake Binary Differences
There are different variants of the Alder Lake Firmware Support Package (FSP) intended for different 12th Generation Intel® Core™ (formerly Alder Lake) SKUs. Please consult the table below:

Directory Name | 12th Generation Intel® Core™ (formerly Alder Lake) SKU Description
:------------- | :-------------------------
Client/AlderLakeP | U-Series, P-Series, & H-Series processors for client platforms
Client/AlderLakeS | HX-Series & desktop processors for client platforms
IoT/AlderLakeP | U-Series, P-Series, & H-Series processors for IoT platforms
IoT/AlderLakePS | PS-Series processors for IoT platforms
IoT/AlderLakeS | Desktop processors for IoT platforms
IoT/AlderLakeN | N-Series processors for IoT platforms

## Differentiating Client and IoT

Client and IoT (Internet of Things) SKUs of 12th Generation Intel® Core™ (formerly Alder Lake) processors can be differentiated by checking the processor number. Processor numbers ending in a "E" are IoT SKUs, processor numbers that do not end in "E" are client SKUs. For example, the Intel® Core™ i7-1270P is a client SKU and the Intel® Core™ i7-1270PE is an IoT SKU.
