# CedarIslandFspBinPkg
This FSP binary is intended to be used with 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors formerly known as Cooper Lake.

## Differentiating Ice Lake and Cooper Lake
3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors may require different FSP
binaries depending on the processor number. Processor numbers ending in an "H"
or "HL" are formerly known as Cooper Lake (supported by the Cedar Island platform).
All other 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors are formerly known as
Ice Lake (supported by the Whitley platform). For example the Intel® Xeon®
Platinum 8380 Processor is Ice Lake and the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8380H Processor
is Cooper Lake.

These FSP binaries can only be used with Cooper Lake. **They will not work with Ice Lake.**
