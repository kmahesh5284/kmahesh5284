config HAS_TASK_CHARGER
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY
	help
	  This turns on the charger task. This deals with monitoring the
	  battery to make sure it is present and is responding properly to
	  requests. If the battery is not full, it enables charging from a
	  suitable power source.

if HAS_TASK_CHARGER

config TASK_CHARGER_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	default 1024	# EC uses VENTI_TASK_STACK_SIZE which is 896
	help
	  The stack size of the charger task.

	  See b/176180736 for checking these stack sizes.

endif # HAS_TASK_CHARGER

config HAS_TASK_CHG_RAMP
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY
	help
	  This turns on the charger ramp task. This attempts to ramp up the
	  current from an attached charger to the maximum available current.
	  It handles the incoming VBUS voltage sagging as well as the user
	  attaching different chargers.

if HAS_TASK_CHG_RAMP

config TASK_CHG_RAMP_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	default 768	# EC uses TASK_STACK_SIZE which is 512 for npcx
	help
	  The stack size of the charger task.

	  See b/176180736 for checking these stack sizes.

endif # HAS_TASK_CHG_RAMP

config HAS_TASK_CHIPSET
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_POWERSEQ
	help
	  This turns on the chipset task which handles powering the chipset
	  on and off. Powering on involves going through a sequence of enabling
	  different power rails (e.g. by enabling GPIOs that control a PMIC)
	  and monitoring power-good indicators to meet the specifications
	  defined by the vendor.

if HAS_TASK_CHIPSET

config TASK_CHIPSET_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	default 1024
	help
	  The stack size of the power button task.

endif # HAS_TASK_CHIPSET

config HAS_TASK_HOSTCMD
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD
	help
	  This turns on the hostcmd task which handles communication with the
	  AP. The AP sends a command to the EC and it responds when able. An
	  interrupt can be used to indicate to the AP that the EC has something
	  for it.

if HAS_TASK_HOSTCMD

config TASK_HOSTCMD_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	default 1024
	help
	  The size of the host-command task stack.

endif # HAS_TASK_HOSTCMD

config HAS_TASK_KEYPROTO
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042
	help
	  This turns on the keyproto task which handles conversion of keyboard
	  scans into i8042 messages on x86 platforms. This is not used or needed
	  on ARM platforms, which send the raw keyboard scans to the AP for
	  processing.

if HAS_TASK_KEYPROTO

config TASK_KEYPROTO_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	default 768
	help
	  The stack size of the keyproto task.

endif # HAS_TASK_KEYPROTO

config HAS_TASK_KEYSCAN
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD
	help
	  This turns on the keyscan task which handles scanning the keyboard
	  and producing a list of changes in the key state. This list can either
	  be sent to the keyboard-protocol task or directly to the AP for
	  processing.

if HAS_TASK_KEYSCAN

config TASK_KEYSCAN_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	default 768
	help
	  The stack size of the keyscan task.

endif # HAS_TASK_KEYSCAN

config HAS_TASK_MOTIONSENSE
	bool
	help
	  This turns on the motion sense task which collects sensor data from the
	  sensors and reports them to AP. Using the data, it also produces other
	  meaningful reports to AP like lid angle and tablet mode.

if HAS_TASK_MOTIONSENSE

config TASK_MOTIONSENSE_STACK_SIZE
	int "motionsense task stack size"
	default 4096
	help
	  The size of the motion sense task stack.

endif # HAS_TASK_MOTIONSENSE

config HAS_TASK_POWERBTN
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_POWER_BUTTON
	help
	  This turns on the powerbtn task which handles monitoring the power
	  button. When the application processor (AP) is off (S5 or G3 states),
	  this task triggers a power-up sequence on a power-button press. When
	  the AP is on (S3 or above state) x86 machines normally reset when the
	  power button is held for 4 seconds but this tasks adjusts that to 8
	  seconds, to allow time for the usual Chromium OS shutdown sequence.

if HAS_TASK_POWERBTN

config TASK_POWERBTN_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	default 1024
	help
	  The stack size of the power-button task.

endif # HAS_TASK_POWERBTN

config HAS_TASK_PD_C0
	bool

	default y if PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_PORT_MAX_COUNT > 0
	help
	  This turns on the PD_C0 task which handles the rather complex USB
	  Power Delivery protocol for port 0. There is one of these tasks for
	  each USB-C port on the device, but they are enabled separately
	  depending on how many ports are present.

config HAS_TASK_PD_C1
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_POWER_DELIVERY

	  This turns on the PD_INT_C0 task which handles servicing of Power
	  Delivery (PD) message interrupts for port 0. There is one of these
	  tasks for each USB-C port on the device, but they are enabled
	  separately depending on how many ports are present.

	int "(all ports) task stack size"
	default 1280	# EC uses VENTI_TASK_STACK_SIZE which is 896
	help
	  The stack size of the USB charger task. If there are multiple tasks,
	  each one gets the same stack size.

	  See b/176180736 for checking these stack sizes.

config HAS_TASK_USB_CHG_P0
	bool
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_CHARGER
	default y if PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_PORT_MAX_COUNT > 0
