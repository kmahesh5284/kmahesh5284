menuconfig PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD
	bool "Keyboard support"
	select HAS_TASK_KEYSCAN
	default n if ARCH_POSIX
	default y
	help
	  Enable compilation of support for scanning a keyboard and providing
	  the resulting input to the AP over the host interface. This consists
	  of a keyboard-scanning task which provides key scans via it calling
	  keyboard_state_changed() (for i8042) or its client calling
	  keyboard_scan_get_state() (for MKBP).

	  Enabling this automatically enables HAS_TASK_KEYSCAN since keyboard
	  scanning must run in its own task.

choice "Protocol select"
	prompt "Select the keyboard protocol to use"
	help
	  Select the keyboard protocol used to communicate key presses to the
	  AP. PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042 is supported by x86-compatible
	  application processors, and PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_MKBP is
	  used for ARM application processors.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042
	bool "i8042"
	select HAS_TASK_KEYPROTO
	help
	  Use the i8042 protocol to communicate with the AP. This dates from the
	  Intel 8042 keyboard controller chip released in 1976. It uses two-way
	  communication via a few 8-bit registers, allowing key codes to be
	  sent to the AP when keys are pressed and released.

	  See here for docs: https://wiki.osdev.org/%228042%22_PS/2_Controller

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_MKBP
	bool "mkbp"
	help
	  Use the MKBP protocol to communicate with the AP. This protocol is
	  usually used on ARM-based platforms. It sends the raw scan code, like
	  (row, col), to the AP and the kernel driver will map this scan code to
	  a key.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_KEYPAD
	bool "Support a numeric keypad"
	help
	  Enable support for a keypad, a palm-sized keyboard section usually
	  placed on the far right. This contains nuumber keys and also some
	  commonly used symbols, to help speed up numeric data entry.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_VIVALDI
	bool "Vivaldi keyboard support"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042
	default y
	help
	  Enable code for Vivaldi keyboard (standard for new Chromium OS
	  devices). A Chromium OS device is Vivaldi compatible if the keyboard
	  matrix complies with: go/vivaldi-matrix.

	  Vivaldi code enables:
	  - A response to EC_CMD_GET_KEYBD_CONFIG command.
	  - Boards can specify their custom layout for top keys.

choice "Power button interference"
	prompt "Select the impact of pressing the power button"
	help
	  On some boards one of the keyboard-scan inputs is affected by pressing
	  the power button. When the power button is pressed, that input needs
	  to be ignored in that case.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PWRBTN_INDEPENDENT
	bool "No impact on keyboard-scan inputs"
	help
	  Select this if pressing the power button does not affect any
	  keyboard-scan inputs.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PWRBTN_ASSERTS_KSI2
	bool "Forces KSI2 to be asserted"
	help
	  Enable this if KSI2 is stuck 'asserted' for all scan columns if the
	  power button is held. We must be aware of this case in order to
	  correctly handle recovery-mode key combinations.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PWRBTN_ASSERTS_KSI3
	bool "Forces KSI3 to be asserted"
	help
	  Enable this if KSI3 is stuck 'asserted' for all scan columns if the
	  power button is held. We must be aware of this case in order to
	  correctly handle recovery-mode key combinations.

endchoice # "Power button interference"

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_COL2_INVERTED
	bool "A mechanism for passing KSO2 to H1 which inverts the signal"
	help
	  This option enables a mechanism for passing the column 2
	  to H1 which inverts the signal. The signal passing through H1
	  adds more delay. Need a larger delay value. Otherwise, pressing
	  Refresh key will also trigger T key, which is in the next scanning
	  column line. See http://b/156007029.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_REFRESH_ROW3
	bool "Move the refresh key matrix to row 3 instead of row 2"
	help
	  The Vivaldi keyboards have the refresh key on row 3 instead of row 2.
	  The legacy keyboards with the assistant key also move the refresh key
	  matrix to row 3. This is used by the boot key detection code to
	  determine if the refresh key is held down at boot.

config PLATFORM_EC_VOLUME_BUTTONS
	bool "Board has volume-up and volume-down buttons"
	help
	  Enable this if the board has physical buttons for the volume controls.
	  These are buttons controlled by GPIOs and are not part of the keyboard
	  matrix.

	  Your board must define GPIO_VOLUME_UP_L and GPIO_VOLUME_DOWN_L in
	  gpio_map.h

config PLATFORM_EC_CMD_BUTTON
	bool "Console command: button"
	help
	  This command simulates button press. The buttons are like volume-up,
	  volume-down, and recovery buttons.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_KEYBOARD
	bool "Console command: ksstate, kbpress, 8042"
	default y if PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD
	help
	  Enable keyboard related console commands.

	    ksstate     - Show or toggle printing keyboard scan state
	    kbpress     - Simulate keypress

	  If PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042 is enabled, it includes 8042
	  command which prints the state of the i8042 keyboard protocol and
	  includes the following subcommands:

	    codeset	- Get/set keyboard codeset
	    ctrlram	- Get/set keyboard controller RAM
	    internal    - Show internal information
	    kbd		- Print or toggle keyboard info
	    kblog	- Print or toggle keyboard event log (current disabled)
	    typematic	- Get/set typematic delays

choice
	prompt "Keyboard backlight"
	optional
	help
	  Enable support for EC control of a keyboard backlight. This enables
	  the "kblight" console command for manual control of the keyboard
	  backlight. This also enables the EC_CMD_PWM_SET_KEYBOARD_BACKLIGHT and
	  EC_CMD_PWM_GET_KEYBOARD_BACKLIGHT host commands for automatic control
	  by the AP.

	  TODO: support CONFIG_IO_EXPANDER_IT8801 driver which provides

config PLATFORM_EC_PWM_KBLIGHT
	bool "PWM keyboard backlight"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_PWM
	help
	  Enables a PWM-controlled keyboard backlight controlled by a PWM signal
	  connected directly to the EC chipset. The board devicetree file must
	  define the PWM channel used for the keyboard backlight control and
	  assign the "kblight" node label to it.
