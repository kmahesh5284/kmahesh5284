	depends on PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD
	default y
	help
	  Enable the reporting of the platform switches state to the AP using
	  memory mapped storage provided by the host command interface.

	  The platform switches include:
	    LID open
	    power button pressed
	    write protect disabled
	    recovery switch

          This also enables the "mmapinfo" console command to report the current
          state of all switches.

choice PLATFORM_EC_SWITCHCAP_TYPE
	prompt "Enable switchcap support"
	optional
	help
	  Enable support for switchcap used to power on the AP.
	  If enabled, type of switchcap must be selected and node in device
	  tree must be added that describes the driver and pins used to control
	  the switchcap.

config PLATFORM_EC_SWITCHCAP_GPIO
	bool "GPIO controlled switchcap"
	help
	  Enable support for the GPIO controlled switchcap.
	  Pins used for controlling the switchcap must be defined in board's
	  device tree.

config PLATFORM_EC_SWITCHCAP_LN9310
	bool "LN9310 switchcap driver"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_I2C
	help
	  Enable support for the LION Semiconductor LN9310 switched
	  capacitor converter.  This will export definitions for
	  ln9310_init, ln9310_interrupt, and ln9310_power_good, which
	  project-specific code should call appropriately if there's
	  no switchcap node in device tree.

config PLATFORM_EC_SYSTEM_UNLOCKED
	bool "System unlocked: allow dangerous commands while in development"
	default y if PLATFORM_EC_BRINGUP
	help
	  System should remain unlocked even if write protect is enabled.

	  NOTE: This should ONLY be defined during bringup, and should never be
	  defined on a shipping / released platform.

	  When defined, CBI allows ectool to reprogram all the fields.
	  Normally, it refuses to change certain fields. (e.g. board version,
	  OEM ID)

	  Also, this enables PD in RO for TCPMv2.

config PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP
	bool "CPU throttling"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_TEMP_SENSOR
	help
	  Enable throttling the CPU based on the temperature sensors. When they
	  detect that the CPU is getting too hot, the CPU is throttled to
	  a lower speed. This reduce the CPU's power output and eventually
	  results in a lower temperature.

menuconfig PLATFORM_EC_TIMER
	bool "Timer module"
	default y
	help
	  Enable compilation of the EC timer module. This provides support for
	  delays, getting the current time and setting alarms.

	  This option is needed by many features in the EC. Disabling it will
	  likely cause build errors.

config PLATFORM_EC_VBOOT_EFS2
	bool "EFS2 verified EC boot"
	default y if !SOC_POSIX
	help
	  Enables Early Firmware Selection v2 (EFS2) verified boot. When booting
	  a Chromium OS image we're actually packing both an RO image and an RW
	  image into flash. The RO image is loaded first. EFS2 runs at boot and
	  verifies the integrity of the RW image by sending a hash of the image
	  to the Google Security Chip (GSC). Once the GSC verifies the hash,
	  EFS2 calls sysjump and reboot the EC using the RW image.

config PLATFORM_EC_VBOOT_HASH
	bool "Host command: EC_CMD_VBOOT_HASH"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD
	default y
	help
	  Allows the AP to request hashing functions from the EC.

	  Verified boot can update the EC's read/write code when it detects
	  that it is an incorrect version. It detects this by asking the EC to
	  hash itself. If the hash is incorrect, new code is write to the EC's
	  read/write area.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	bool "Secure temporary storage for verified boot"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for storing a block of data received from the AP so it
	  can be read back later by the AP. This is helpful since the AP may
	  reboot or resume and want the data early in its start-up before it
	  has access to SDRAM.

	  There are a fixed number of slots and each can hold a fixed amount of
	  data (EC_VSTORE_SLOT_SIZE bytes). Once a slot is written it is locked
	  and cannot be written again unless explicitly unlocked.

	  Stored data is preserved when the EC moved from RO to RW.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE_SLOT_COUNT
	int "Number of slots"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	default 1
	help
	  Set the number of slots available in the verified-boot store. The
	  number required depends on the AP firmware. Typically the vstore is
	  used only for recording a hash of the read-write AP firmware for
	  checking on resume. For this, one slot is enough.

menuconfig PLATFORM_EC_WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	default y
	help
	  Enable the watchdog functionality. The watchdog timer will reboot the
	  system if the hook task (which is the lowest-priority task on the
	  system) gets starved for CPU time and isn't able to fire its
	  HOOK_TICK event.

	  Chromium EC system uses an auxiliary timer to handle the system
	  warning event. This leaves some time to the system for preparing &
	  printing the debug information. The interval between reloads of the
	  watchdog timer should be less than half of the auxiliary timer
	  (PLATFORM_EC_WATCHDOG_PERIOD_MS -
	  PLATFORM_EC_WATCHDOG_WARNING_LEADING_TIME_MS).

config PLATFORM_EC_WORKAROUND_FLASH_DOWNLOAD_API
	bool "Workaround needed for npcx9 ES1 chip"
	depends on SOC_SERIES_NPCX9
	help
	  There's a bug in the flash download API on the ES1 version of the
	  npcx9 chips that requires some workarounds. This is needed for sysjump
	  to work properly.

config PLATFORM_EC_ASSERT_CCD_MODE_ON_DTS_CONNECT
	bool "Assert CCD Mode"
	help
	  Assert CCD_MODE_ODL when a DTS debug accessory is connected to the
	  CCD USBC port. GPIO_CCD_MODE_ODL should be configured with
	  GPIO_ODR_HIGH flag.

config PLATFORM_EC_CCD_USBC_PORT_NUMBER
	int "CCD USB Port Number"
	default 0
	help
	  USB port number of the CCD enabled USBC port.

config PLATFORM_EC_I2C_PASSTHRU_RESTRICTED
	bool "Restrict I2C PASSTHRU command"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_I2C
	help
	  Enables board-specific restrictions for the I2C PASSTHRU host command.
	  Once enabled, board_allow_i2c_passthru function has to be implemented,
	  which defines the allowed usage of the command.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_COMMAND_STATUS
	bool "Return in-progress status for slow host commands"
	default y if PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_SHI
	help
	  When the AP is attached to the EC via a serialized bus such as I2C or
	  SPI, it needs a way to minimize the length of time an EC command will
	  tie up the bus (and the kernel driver on the AP). If this config is
	  defined, the EC may return an in-progress result code for slow
	  commands such as flash erase/write instead of stalling until the
	  command finishes processing, and the AP may then inquire the status
	  of the current command and/or the result of the previous command.

config PLATFORM_EC_AMD_SB_RMI
	bool "Enable driver for AMD SB-RMI interface"
	help
	  AMD platforms provide the Side-Band Remote Management Interface.
	  SB-RMI provides an interface for an external SMBus master to perform
	  tasks such as managing power consumption and power limits of the CPU
	  socket.

config PLATFORM_EC_AMD_STT
	bool "Enable driver for AMD STT interface"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_AMD_SB_RMI
	help
	  AMD platforms provide the Skin Temperature Tracking (STT) interface.
	  Skin temperature management can be used to maximize the system
	  performance while keeping the skin temperature within its
	  specification. It makes use of the thermal capacitance of the system
	  to temporarily boost above the sustainable power limit, while the
	  chassis skin temperatures are below limits.

config PLATFORM_EC_MATH_UTIL
	bool "Math utility"
	default y
	help
	  Math utilities including bitmask manipulation, division rounding,
	  trigonometric function, etc.
