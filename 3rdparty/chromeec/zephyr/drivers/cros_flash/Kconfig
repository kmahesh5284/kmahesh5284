	help
	  This option enables a flash unit interface (FIU) driver for the NPCX
	  chip. This is used instead of the flash memory interface so we can
	  continue to use most of the existing flash memory processing code in
	  ECOS.

	  This sets the priority of the NPCX flash driver for zephyr shim.
	  This driver depends on the SPI controller and SPI NOR flash drivers.
	  Its priority must be lower than CONFIG_SPI_INIT_PRIORITY and
	  CONFIG_SPI_NOR_INIT_PRIORITY.
